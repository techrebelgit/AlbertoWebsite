## Trustless Work: Our Journey So Far

[Trustless Work website](https://www.trustlesswork.com)

#### **1. Introduction: The Vision Behind Trustless Work**

* **Escrow Solution for Modern Transactions**: Trustless Work provides next-generation escrows, to provide secure and transparent payments without the need for intermediaries. This allows platforms to focus on their growth while we handle the complexities of trust and payment security.
* **API for Seamless Integration**: Platforms like marketplaces, directories, and fintechs can easily integrate escrow services into their business model through our API, offering transparent and secure transactions.

#### **2. The Problem: Origins of Trustless Work**

* **Personal Experience in Product Management**: Alberto's experience running a digital product agency showed the inefficiencies and risks associated with traditional contracting and payment models.
  * **Client & Service Provider Dual Role**: Acting both as a client for Argentine development teams and as a service provider for U.S. clients highlighted issues such as payment delays, cash flow crunches, and high upfront costs.
  * **Risky Payment Models**: The typical payment structure—50% upfront and 50% upon delivery—was risky for both clients and service providers, making it clear that a better system was needed.

#### **3. The Solution: Escrows for milestone-based payments**

* **Using Escrows to Mitigate Risks**: An agile payment system using decentralized escrow contracts to ensure transparency and security for all parties.
* **Traditional Escrow Limitations**: Conventional escrows involve banks, lawyers, and high costs, making them inefficient for smaller contracts.
* **Examples of Use in Industry**: Platforms like eBay and Upwork utilize escrow services to mitigate risks between buyers and sellers.

#### **4. Draper Hacker House: A Pivotal Moment**

* **Validation from Fellow Entrepreneurs**: Participating in the Draper Hacker House was a key moment, where many fellow founders showed interest in integrating our escrow product into their platforms.
  * **Diverse Use Cases**: Identified use cases across multiple platforms—freelancer services, influencer platforms, etc.—showing a broad need for a trustless escrow solution.
* **Focus Shift**: After positive feedback from Tim Draper, Denelle Dixon from Stellar, and others, Trustless Work focused on building an API-first solution, becoming an Escrow-as-a-Service provider.

#### **5. Building the API and Sponsoring a Hackathon**

* **Returning to Costa Rica**: Continued developing the API and set a milestone for launching the first version, to sponsor a hackathon and get devs to build and provide feedback, we used 10% of the grant money from Astro Hacker House.
* **Hackathon Sponsorship**: Sponsored the Eth Pura Vida hackathon that concluded last week:
  * **55 devs registered, 35 Developers participated  in 8 teams**: Developers tested and built using the first version of our API.
  * **Diverse Use Cases Built**: Projects included house rentals, agriculture, privacy solutions, and revenue-sharing models for Uber cars.
  * **Community Growth**: Created a Telegram group with over 30 members and began receiving feedback on our code, docs and vision.
  * **Leads for Reference Customers**: Connected with potential customers who are interested in integrating our escrow solution.

#### **6. Upcoming Milestones**

* **Draper Embark Program**: Selected to participate in Draper Embark in November—a 10-week program with:
  * **10 Startups from Around the World**: Access to mentorship and investment of $50k from Stellar-DraperU.
  * **Access to Experience**: Aiming to refine our product strategy, tokenomics, go-to market and scale further.
  * \*\*Demo day to investors: \*\* Program concludes with public demo day with investors&#x20;
*   **Getting on Only Dust**: Aiming to join Only Dust, a platform for open source bounties, in November. This will require:

    Well-Groomed Backlog: Preparing a refined backlog and well-defined issues for contributors.
*

**7. Future Vision: What We Aim to Become**

* **Scaling the Escrow Ecosystem**: Envisioning Trustless Work as a core part of how businesses manage payments and reduce risks, we will focus on building our open source tools
* \*\*Expanding Use Cases with partners \*\*: Beyond marketplaces and freelancing, extending into industries like real estate, agriculture, fintech and more.
* **Building a Trustless Ecosystem**: Empowering platforms to integrate transparent, decentralized transactions while abstracting the blockchain complexities from their users.
